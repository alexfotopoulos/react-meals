## Description

React-Meals is a project built as part of a [React course offered by Acadamind](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) via Udemy. The style and layout of the project is show to the class and a walk through is conducted by the constructor. However, I built this after looking at the images of the end result, but before any walk throughs were conducted. The app has a set menu of items which can be added to an order and submitted by a user. The data sent to and stored in Google Firebase.

The app is built using React, React Context for app-wide state management, Bootstrap, and Firebase for backend functionality and data storage.
